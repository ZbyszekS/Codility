Main points:
- You need to convert int to form of zeros and ones
-- that can be done by:
---- Integer.toString(N, 2)
---- Integer.toBinaryString(N);

- It's better to convert string of '0' and '1' to array of chars
-- that can be done by: s.toCharArray();

- You need to count zeros between ones which is trivial
